# street-fighter-smartbot
A machine learning-based bot that plays Street Fighter by analyzing game states and making real-time decisions. This project uses a tuned Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model with scaled features to predict optimal moves. Includes modular Python scripts, trained models (.pkl, .joblib), and a Jupyter notebook for testing and evaluation.
